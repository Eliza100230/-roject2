# Project 2
This is for project code used in ITEC 4800

Welcome to Project 2! In this project, I was tasked with creating a monthly mortgage calculator using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This one took a bit, but I was able to complete it. All you, as the user, need to do is enter the Loan Amount, Interest Rate (without the % sign), and the Term Amount in years. Then it'll spit out the result below. If, for whatever reason, this code fails, let me know immediately.
